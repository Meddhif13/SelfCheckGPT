He faced opposition from traditionalists who resisted the changes he sought to implement, but he also gained support from those who embraced the new Protestant faith. His leadership helped to solidify the presence of Protestantism in the north, contributing to the wider acceptance of these reforms across England.\n\nIn addition to his ecclesiastical duties, Holgate was involved in various political matters, reflecting the close relationship between the Church and the state during this period. His influence extended beyond religious affairs, as he participated in key decisions that shaped the future of England during a time of significant upheaval.\n\nHolgate passed away in 1555, leaving behind a legacy as a pivotal figure in the English Reformation and a key architect of the Protestant movement in northern England.
